1. If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

Based on the given data in "sogns.db", I would just average them and do modelling it based on the AVG data set.
So that the listener's preference can be positioned to where the listener gets attracted.
It might indicate the character of the audio aura for the year.

2. Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener.
What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

Firstly, it is crucial to determine how the top 100 songs are selected. (Merely based on the number of views or not)
This is because a large number of views can include noisy data,
such as generated by excessive clicking or simply played becuase they are in Top100 chart.
If I were to make a recommendation, I would suggest allowing each individual to "like" a song only once
and then evaluating the songs based on the accumulated number of likes.
Although this method may not be perfect, it is a better approach as it can eliminate spurious data.
