Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

I dont think it goes wrong if the number has been increased. As the number of sumulations increased,
thepredictions bcame more accurate and stable i guess.
There were no incorrect predictions as the numver of simulations increased.
However, the prediction is just an opinion which is based on data.
It could be a part of reference, but the answer.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

I think 10000 simulations to get reasonably accurate predictions at this simulation
as a good starting point. Of course the number of simulations required to achieve "fair enough" point
to make decision such as the complexity of the tournament, players, relative record and so on.
But based on the numbers I have here, 10000 simulations can be a good start before considering other things
as it shows quite big difference compare to lower number and faster than bigger number.
