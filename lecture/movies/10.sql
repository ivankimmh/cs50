--In 10.sql, write a SQL query to list the names of all people who have directed a movie
--that received a rating of at least 9.0.
--Your query should output a table with a single column for the name of each person.
--If a person directed more than one movie that received a rating of at least 9.0,
--they should only appear in your results once.

SELECT DISTINCT name FROM people JOIN directors ON people.id = directors.person_id JOIN movies ON directors.movie_id = movies.id JOIN ratings ON movies.id = ratings.movie_id WHERE rating >= 9.0;
